            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>
                Florida native, Washington raised since 2000. I have been married to my wife for 9 years.
                We have a 19 month old son named Sebastian and will have our daughter Athena in December.
                I am big into football and basketball. I also enjoy comics, video games, and I am a pretty dope bowler.
                I have played the drums since age 6 or 7 and I played the trombone from middle school into high school.
                My wife and I are archery hunters, just deer for now, but we do want to expand our horizons.
                Golf is the next thing I look to add to my skillset because it is chill, relaxing, and would totally
                make me feel like more of an adult.
